For Loop -  "What is a for loop used for?" : "Repeating a block of code a fixed number of times."
For Loop -  "What are the three parts of a for loop?" : "Loop variable, range, code body."
For Loop -  "How does the range() function work in a for loop?" : "It specifies the values the loop variable takes on in each iteration."
For Loop -  "Can you loop through a specific range (e.g., 5 to 10) using range()?" : "Yes, use range(start, stop) syntax."
For Loop -  "Can you loop through even numbers in a range using range()?" : "Yes, use range(start, stop, step) syntax with step set to 2."

While Loop -  "What is a while loop used for?" : "Repeating a block of code until a condition is met."
While Loop -  "When would you use a while loop over a for loop?" : "When you don't know how many times the loop should run."
While Loop -  "What happens if a while loop condition never becomes False? (Infinite Loop)" : "The loop will run forever, which is usually an error."
While Loop -  "How can you avoid infinite loops with while loops?" : "Ensure the condition eventually becomes False within the loop's body."
